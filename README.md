Arithmetic Coding
=================

This is just for fun. You wanna awesome compressing/decompressing implementation of arithmetic encoder? Fork this awesome, awesome proj3k.

## Why another Arithmetic encoder/decoder?

Because we are busy-body lot of people; that is why. We re-inventing the wheels to wrap our brains around as an exercise to keep ourselves smart.

Todo list:
- [x] Some unusable code mess
- [ ] working encoder/decoder
- [x] file streaming (can't run yet)
- [ ] compressing a single file
- [ ] compressing multiple files + their metadata
